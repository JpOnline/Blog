## I now declare it is opened the documentation week.
**The goal is to have a prototype by the end of the week**

I can see several problems related to that, when I get to work in big projects that exists for a long time, I usually 
spend a lot of energy to understand what is happening, what are the main elements, the domain entities. It might be because documentation gets unsynced with the code, but could be something else and what I'm going to do is to address this problem and produce a prototype by the end of the week. So if you have time, interest and energy, please contribute with insights. Thank you.
