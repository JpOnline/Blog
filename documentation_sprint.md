## I now declare it is opened the documentation week.
**The goal is to have a prototype by the end of the week**

I can see several problems related to that, when I get to work in big projects that exists for a long time, I usually 
spend a lot of energy to understand what is happening, what are the main elements, the domain entities. It might be because documentation gets unsynced with the code, but could be something else and what I'm going to do is to address this problem and produce a prototype by the end of the week. So if you have time, interest and energy, please contribute with insights. Thank you.

## Introduction
My name is Jo√£o Paulo, I love to code and create real solutions for real problems. I love the Clojure programming language and I'm using it for about 2 years to create Progressive Web Apps using Web Components as a Free Lancer.

## The process
I'll address the problem of **documentation in software** for 5 days, each day with a very important role.

1. Map the problem
2. Sketch solutions
3. Decide the solution to prototype
4. Prototype
5. Test

# Day 1
## Goal
- A tool that developers can run in a code base to **extract knowledge** or **facilitate code documentation**.
- Have 100 people answering 100% for the question: "What's the probability for you to recommend this tool for a friend or coworker?" The number is arbitrary but it's basically to find a niche with the [Net Promoter Score (NPS)](https://www.lightercapital.com/blog/net-promoter-score-how-to-calculate-nps/)
